<h2>ABOUT ME AND C3S MAM</h2>
<div class="box" id="box2">My name is Tatenda Getrude Mudzonga and I am currently a student
    at C3S Business School. My country of origin is Zimbabwe and I arrived in Spain, Barcelona
    in October 2023. The reason why I created this platform is because , I wanted future students
    of C3S Business School to find a current student to help them with their journey in Barcelona
     and C3S Business School. I know how hard it is to adapt to a new environment with different 
     cultures and languages. So I wanted to help other students to find people who can advise and
      guide them with anything concerning school and social life in Barcelona. There are five mentors
      on this platform and hopefully we can increase the mentors as time goes on. I hope this platform 
    will help you all. Good Luck !!!!
